Dataset of 1000 people
Out of 1000 say 10% responded to the campaign;

Split into 2 parts - Training(70%) and Validation(30%)

Customers in validation data set are : 300
Responders in validation data set are : 10% of 300 = 30
Decile is 10%

First 10% of the sorted validation set: 30
out of the first 30 people only 9 of the responders were correctly identified
gain of responders is 9/30 = 30%

Next 10% (i.e 20%) of the sorted validation set: 30
out of the next 30 people only 6 were actual responders
gain of responders is 6/30 = 20%
cumulative gain = 30% + 20% = 50%

next 10% (i.e 30&) of the sorted validation set : 30
out of next 30 people only 4.5 responded
gain of responders = 4.5/30 = 15%
cumulative gain = 30% + 20% + 15% = 65%

Categorical - they are categories like fraudulent/authorized
 - Nominal - where order doesnâ€™t matter
	colors, Purchase/notPurchase, gender
 - Ordinal - where order matters
	likertScale(1-5), good/better/best

Continuous - where we can take difference
Age, income
